Basic Statistics Operations for Model Building
Welcome to the Basic Statistics Operations for Model Building repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering basic
statistical operations necessary for model building and regression analysis using Python.

Overview
Understanding basic statistical operations is essential for building and interpreting regression models. 
This repository covers fundamental statistical concepts and techniques required for model building, including finding slopes, intercepts, and performing regression analysis.
Contents
1. Descriptive Statistics
Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode.
Measures of dispersion: variance, standard deviation.
2. Correlation Analysis
Pearson correlation coefficient: measuring the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables.
Scatter plots: visualizing the relationship between variables.
3. Simple Linear Regression
Understanding the simple linear regression model.
Finding the slope and intercept of the regression line.
Visualizing the regression line on a scatter plot.
4. Multiple Linear Regression
Extending the simple linear regression model to multiple predictors.
Understanding multiple regression coefficients.
Model interpretation and evaluation.
5. Model Building
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Fitting regression models to training data.
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. Case Studies
Practical examples and case studies demonstrating the application of basic statistics operations for model building and regression analysis.
Datasets and analysis techniques to reinforce learning.
Requirements
Python (3.x recommended)
NumPy, SciPy, pandas (for data manipulation and statistical analysis)
Matplotlib, seaborn (for data visualization)
scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)
